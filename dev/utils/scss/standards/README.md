# CSS Standardizations

Contains standardized SCSS variables and mixins. All variables and mixins are
prefixed with "std-" to indicate that they should NOT be overwritten directly,
though they can be used as values in equations.

It's worth noting that none of the variables or mixins in this directory
generate code unless invoked, they can be included in any other scss file
without side effects.
